Run the Deployment Script:
    - node deploy.js

This script will:
    - Install the gh-pages package
    - Update the homepage in package.json with your GitHub username
    - Build the project
    - Deploy to GitHub Pages

Check GitHub Pages Settings
    1. Go to your GitHub repository
    2. Click "Settings" > "Pages"
    3. Verify the source is set to "gh-pages" branch

Access Your Deployed Site
Wait a few minutes for deployment to complete, then visit:
    - e.g: https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/pokkaTheFutureWithAI

Update Process:
1. Make your changes to the project files
2. Commit those changes to your local Git repository
3. Run node deploy.js to:
    - Ensure gh-pages package is installed
    - Update homepage URL in package.json (if your username changed)
    - Build the project with latest changes
    - Deploy to GitHub Pages
4. Push your code changes to GitHub:
    - git push origin master  # or main

What Happens When You Run deploy.js Again
The script will:

    - Rebuild your project with the latest code
    - Deploy the new build to the gh-pages branch
    - Update your live site with the changes

Alternative Update Method
If you prefer not to use the deploy.js script every time, you can also use:
    - npm run deploy

This works if:

You've already run deploy.js once before
1. The gh-pages package is installed
2. Your package.json already has the correct homepage URL
3. The deploy.js script is mainly helpful for the initial setup and ensuring all dependencies are in place.
